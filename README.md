# Next.js Auth Starter Template

## Motivation

Implementing authentication in Next.js, especially Email+Password authentication, can be challenging. NextAuth intentionally limits email password functionality to discourage the use of passwords due to security risks and added complexity. However, in certain projects, clients may require user password authentication. Lucia offers a flexible alternative to NextAuth.js, providing more customization options without compromising on security. This template serves as a starting point for building a Next.js app with Lucia authentication.

## Lucia vs. NextAuth.js

Lucia is less opinionated than NextAuth, offering greater flexibility for customization. While Lucia involves more setup, it provides a higher degree of flexibility, making it a suitable choice for projects requiring unique authentication configurations.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** üíº Support for Credential and OAuth authentication.
- **Authorization:** üîí Easily manage public and protected routes within the `app directory`.
- **Email Verification:** üìß Verify user identities through email.
- **Password Reset:** üîë Streamline password resets by sending email password reset links.
- **Lucia + tRPC:** üîÑ Similar to NextAuth with tRPC, granting access to sessions and user information through tRPC procedures.
- **Email template with react-email:** ‚úâÔ∏è Craft your email templates using React.
- **MySQL Database:** üõ¢Ô∏è Utilize a MySQL database (Planetscale) set up using Drizzle for enhanced performance and type safety.
- **Database Migration:** üöÄ Included migration script to extend the database schema according to your project needs.
